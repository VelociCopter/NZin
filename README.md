A prototyping engine/framework. It is designed for Unity, but utilizes minimal GameObject/MonoBehaviour code to allow for much easier Unit testing and use outside of Unity. It contains features commonly found in games like townbuilders or brawlers. This framework was created and is maintained primarily for prototyping various game concepts.
